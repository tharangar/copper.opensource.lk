Knowing each tool it was used will be good approach to know the solution well. MTA (Mail Transfer Agent ) - POSTFIX Postfix has been selected as the MTA in copper solution due to some of following advantages we found in postfix. To allow the server to send external emails, an MTA such as Sendmail, Postfix, or Exim is required. Mail is read either through direct access (shell login) or mailbox protocols like POP and IMAP. Postfix If you compare mail servers, then Postfix should be included, too, because it is also a popular mail server. It is a better mail server because it supports most of the current innovations in a modern-day mail server including but not limited to: \u2022 Virtual domains \u2022 SMTP relay \u2022 Consultation of SMTP client on its whitelist, grey list and blacklist databases \u2022 Host and user masquerading \u2022 Delivery to mailboxes with Maildir format As you compare mail servers, you will observe that Postfix utilises two large monolithic configuration files instead of the multiple task-oriented configuration files. You will then have to learn a single set of configuration file keywords. So we selected postfix considering It's popularity in integration projects and adaptability with new featues too. Simple SMTP server. POSTFIX . MDA (Mail Delevery Agent) - DOVECOT Dovecot is an open source IMAP and POP3 email server for Linux/UNIX-like systems, written with security primarily in mind.

DOVECOT . SPAM FILTER - RSPAMD Rspamd is an advanced spam filtering system that allows evaluation of messages by a number of rules including regular expressions, statistical analysis and custom services such as URL black lists. Each message is analysed by Rspamd and given a spam score. According to this spam score and the user\u2019s settings, Rspamd recommends an action for the MTA to apply to the message, for example, to pass, reject or add a header. Rspamd is designed to process hundreds of messages per second simultaneously, and provides a number of useful features. Here is the list of C modules available bundled with rspamd. chartable: checks character sets of text parts in messages. dkim: performs DKIM signatures checks. fuzzy_check: checks messages fuzzy hashes against public blacklists. spf: checks SPF records for messages processed. surbl: this module extracts URLs from messages and check them against public DNS black lists to filter messages with malicious URLs. regexp: the core module that allow to define regexp rules, rspamd internal functions and lua rules. Lua modules Lua modules are dynamically loaded on rspamd startup and are reloaded on rspamd reconfiguration. Should you want to write a lua module consult with the Lua API documentation. To define path to lua modules there is a special section named modules in rspamd: modules { path = /path/to/dir/ ; path = /path/to/module.lua ; path = $PLUGINSDIR/lua ; } If a path is a directory then rspamd scans it for `*.lua\u201d pattern and load all files matched. The following Lua modules are enabled in the default configuration (but may require additional configuration to work, see notes below): antivirus - integrates virus scanners (requires configuration) arc - checks and signs ARC signatures asn - looks up ASN-related information etc * * Fast, free and open-source spam filtering. RSPAMD Comparisson with other spam filters. SPAM FILTERS SPF - Sender Policy Framework Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email authentication method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails (email spoofing), a technique often used in phishing and email spam. SPF allows the receiver to check that an email claiming to come from a specific domain comes from an IP address authorized by that domain's administrators. The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the DNS records for that domain. Authorize email senders with SPF Help prevent spoofing from your domain Set up SPF to prevent spammers from sending unauthorized emails from your domain. This type of spamming is called spoofing. Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email security method to prevent spoofing from your domain. Spoofing is a common unauthorized use of email, so some email servers require SPF. If you don't set up SPF for your domain, messages could bounce or could be marked as spam. Use SPF with DKIM and DMARC Along with SPF, we recommend setting up DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting Conformance (DMARC). SPF validates the domains that can send messages. DKIM verifies that message content is authentic and not changed. DMARC specifies how your domain handles suspicious emails that it gets. Create an SPF record for your domain An SPF record is a TXT record that lists the mail servers that are allowed to send email from your domain. Messages sent from a server that isn't the SPF record might be marked as spam. SPF originally used TXT records in DNS, which are supposed to be free-form text with no semantics attached. SPF proponents readily acknowledge that it would be better to have records specifically designated for SPF, but this choice was made to enable rapid implementation of SPF. In July 2005, IANA assigned the Resource Record type 99 to SPF. Later on, the use of SPF records was discontinued, and as of 2017, it is still necessary to use TXT records. Fast, free and open-source spam filtering. SPF Create TXT Record in DNS for SPF . TXT Record Creation DKIM - DomainKeys Identified Mail DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) lets an organization take responsibility for a message that is in transit. The organization is a handler of the message, either as its originator or as an intermediary. Their reputation is the basis for evaluating whether to trust the message for further handling, such as delivery. Technically DKIM provides a method for validating a domain name identity that is associated with a message through cryptographic authentication. DKIM allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain. It achieves this by affixing a digital signature, linked to a domain name, to each outgoing email message. The recipient system can verify this by looking up the sender's public key published in the DNS. A valid signature also guarantees that some parts of the email (possibly including attachments) have not been modified since the signature was affixed. Usually, DKIM signatures are not visible to end-users, and are affixed or verified by the infrastructure rather than the message's authors and recipients. DomainKeys Identified Mail . DKIM DKIM technical specification. DKIM SPECIFICATION DMARK - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting Conformance DMARC, which stands for \u201cDomain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance\u201d, is an email authentication, policy, and reporting protocol. It builds on the widely deployed SPF and DKIM protocols, adding linkage to the author (\u201cFrom:\u201d) domain name, published policies for recipient handling of authentication failures, and reporting from receivers to senders, to improve and monitor protection of the domain from fraudulent email. DMARC is designed to fit into an organization\u2019s existing inbound email authentication process. The way it works is to help email receivers determine if the purported message \u201caligns\u201d with what the receiver knows about the sender. If not, DMARC includes guidance on how to handle the \u201cnon-aligned\u201d messages. For example, assuming that a receiver deploys SPF and DKIM, plus its own spam filters, the flow may look something like this: Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting Conformance . DMARK OPENLDAP - Openldap is used as the userbase and email server domain configuration management portal. OpenLDAP is a free, open-source implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) developed by the OpenLDAP Project. It is released under its own BSD-style license called the OpenLDAP Public License. LDAP is a platform-independent protocol. Several common Linux distributions include OpenLDAP Software for LDAP support. The software also runs on BSD-variants, as well as AIX, Android, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris, Microsoft Windows (NT and derivatives, e.g. 2000, XP, Vista, Windows 7, etc.), and z/OS. OpenLDAP has three main components: slapd \u2013 stand-alone LDAP daemon and associated modules and tools libraries implementing the LDAP protocol and ASN.1 Basic Encoding Rules (BER) client software: ldapsearch, ldapadd, ldapdelete, and others Opensource LDAP server .

GROUPOFFICE DOCKER Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code. In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer.
